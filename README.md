# União Esquadrias Landing Page

Static landing page built with Tailwind CSS to showcase União Esquadrias, a Brazilian aluminum joinery company. The page highlights services, markets served, project galleries, process timeline, and contact information with placeholders ready for final imagery.

## Features
- Tailwind CDN setup with custom palette aligned to the company logo colors.
- Responsive hero block, service grid, industries overview, project cards, process timeline, and contact panel.
- Placeholder cards for photos and moodboards to be replaced with real assets.
- Ready for GitHub Pages deployment (single `index.html`).

## Project Structure
- `index.html` – main landing page with all sections and Tailwind utilities.
- `assets/logo.png` – company logo referenced in the page header.

## Development
1. Edit `index.html` directly to adjust copy, sections, or placeholders.
2. Replace placeholder blocks with actual images (upload to `assets/` and update the `src`).
3. Preview locally by opening `index.html` in a browser.

## Deployment
Publish the repository with GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → choose the `main` branch and `/root`). Changes to `index.html` become live after pushing to the repository.
